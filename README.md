# KRT Engine
Edited version of K&R GMS2 engine that includes
better save system that doesn't break when new variables are added
better options/pause system 
improved music system 
built in dialogue system with language support (90% finished)
built in achievement system 
epic camera over
screen shake and screen flash built in 
event system for story progression

a few more things are planned such as more neat player movement and fixed platforms but i'll finish those at a later date. 

# WARNING
this engine was made pretty much for me and me only so a lot of the code may be confusing
i'm making this public incase for some reason one person wants to use it but i still recommend using the original engine for now.
